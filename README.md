**SFML**
This was my First Project after installation of SFML which took Almost a Day(24 hours) oh GOD!!!
I Tried the basic of SDL2 before this and I then switched to SFML because it was a bit easier to set up and render a 
window

**TEXTUREs**
I learnt about textures how to create em how to infinitely scroll em in the BG It was a little tough but i got some help
from our friend CHATGPT. So yea It was fun

**TEXT**
I then learnt about texts and btns, I created a function that made it fast and easy to create text not super fast just about 15 secs fast but yea it was fun
I though there was a button class or stuff in SFML but i did'nt found anything on first TRY so i created a shape as a btn and added text on top
The coordinates and sizing sys is a bit discomforting but I'm thinking about to solve these kind of stuff so NW

**BYE ðŸ˜€**
